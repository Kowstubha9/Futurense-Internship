# Exploratory Data Analysis on India Tourism Dataset
The code and visualizations needed to do an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset on tourism in India are included in this repository. Gaining knowledge about travel trends, visitor demographics, and prospective growth areas for the Indian tourism sector are the main objectives of this  project.

## Data Description
India tourism dataset is a csv file which typically encompass data related to tourist activity within India.It includes the following information:
* Who: Where tourists come from (countries) and their age groups.
* When: When they visit (arrival dates, months, or seasons).
* Where: Places they visit within India (cities, regions).
* How They Arrived: Mode of transport (air, train, etc.).

By analyzing this data, we can understand tourist demographics, behavior, popular destinations, and potential areas for growth in the Indian tourism industry.

## Steps
* **Data Acquisition and Cleaning:**
  * Loading of dataset
  * Handling missing values and outliers
* **Data understadning:**
  * Exploring the attributes of the data
* **Tourist Demographics Analysis:**
  * Analysis on the age distribution of tourists visiting India
  * Examining tourist nationalities
  * Analysis on gender distribution
* **Travel Patterns Analysis:**
  * Analysis on seasonality of tourist arrivals to know about peak and off-season trends
  * Examining preferred modes of transport used by tourists to reach India
* **Destination Analysis:**
  * Examining any relationships that might exist between the age and nationality of tourists and their favorite travel locations.
  * Based on the frequency of visits, determining which Indian tourist spots are the most popular.
* **Visualization:**
  * Creating visualizations to showcase trends in seasonality, travel duration, and tourist demographics.
  * Effectively communicating data insights using data visualization techniques (bar charts, histograms, heatmaps).

## Tools and techniques
Python with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, pyplot and seaborn 

## Conclusion
We can obtain insightful knowledge that will help the tourist industry make decisions by performing a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the India tourism dataset. Many stakeholders can benefit from these information, including government agencies, travel agencies and hospitality industry.
